# Bibleit clients and CLI: revised implementation plan

Revised 2026-10-10 against the local `../bibleit-server` checkout. Its HEAD is
`0482211`, with substantial uncommitted changes; this is a working-tree review,
not a compatibility claim against a published server release. This revision
supersedes the earlier sequence of extracting Go and immediately porting the
same surface into Python, Ruby, and Rust.

## Decisions retained

Use Go 1.27.1 or newer for the CLI and Go client. Keep the CLI dependent on the
client, with browser opening, presentation, and credential persistence outside
core library operations. Use HTTPS/bearer authentication as the default finite
command transport; retain explicit SSH support. No automatic mutation retries.

Keep the language clients together in a client monorepo with independent
versions, package releases, and compatibility declarations. Keep the server
and native translation engine separate. Before publication, settle whether the
existing `bibleit` repository becomes that monorepo and resolve its Python TUI's
existing `bibleit` executable name. The Go client currently shares this CLI
module; do not publish that temporary package path and then immediately move it.

## What changed and why it matters

| Current server evidence | Client/CLI consequence |
| --- | --- |
| Personal and organization resource accounts; scoped owner/admin/operator/viewer membership | Model authenticated identity separately from resource workspace. Do not equate a protocol actor with universal resource ownership. |
| Starter/Contributor access and organization capacity; CLI credentials have a separate cap of 10 | Read effective quotas from the server. Correct the CLI's token-quota advice; login credentials do not consume the manual-token plan allowance. |
| Token scope/expiry metadata and settings-based rotation with overlap | Distinguish login credentials from automation tokens; preserve metadata and revoked/expired/retiring error behavior. Rotation is not yet a general command-client operation. |
| SSH accepts Ed25519, RSA SHA-2, and NIST ECDSA | The CLI's explicit-identity Ed25519 restriction is behind the server. Align validation without weakening host verification. |
| HTTP command limit: 8192 command bytes and 16384 body bytes; command and search rate limits | Validate UTF-8 byte limits before sending, including JSON overhead. Preserve 429/error metadata; provide useful size and retry diagnostics. |
| A separate browser-authenticated Live management WebSocket | Distinguish audience subscription from management watching. Management observers should not consume audience quota. |
| Browser-only organization settings, Live workspace movement, design, collaborations, stack reorder/removal | These features need an explicit public integration contract before CLI commands or client methods are promised. |
| Documentation reorganized into protocol, HTTP, and domain references | Use those sources and implementation tests as contract inputs; avoid treating prose alone as executable truth. |

The HTTP command envelope still takes `{"command":"..."}` and returns protocol
v1 records. Existing command builders, decoding, and HTTP tests remain useful.
They do not establish coverage of the new organization/browser surfaces.

## Contract gaps to resolve first

1. The protocol reference documents `LIVE <id> SECRET SET <value>`, but
   `src/protocol/bibleit_protocol.erl:live_secret/2` still accepts CREATE,
   ROTATE, DELETE, and connection authentication only. The original CLI mapped
   `secret set` to authentication; it now rejects that unsupported operation.
   The server documentation/parser mismatch remains unresolved. Decide the server grammar and remove this ambiguity
   before release; never silently turn management into authentication.
2. Both WebSocket surfaces currently use browser cookies; management watching
   also checks Origin and revalidates management access. Neither is an existing
   bearer-token client event endpoint.
3. Organization appears in domain authority, but the command parser provides no
   explicit organization/workspace selection or management commands. A profile
   preference cannot invent server-side workspace authorization.
4. Request quoting still cannot represent embedded double quotes. V1 response
   framing is implicit in known headers. Resolve or formally document these
   constraints and test them against the server before freezing client APIs.
5. The native CLI is explicitly described as unpublished/in development in the
   server documentation. Our current local command/output shapes are drafts,
   including raw record JSON. The unsupported `secret set` alias has been removed.

## Delivery sequence and acceptance gates

### 1. Reconcile and verify the public integration contract

Inventory each candidate operation with its endpoint or command, authentication
mode, authority, request/response, limits, errors, and supported server baseline.
Add request fixtures beside existing response fixtures. Verify their wire
semantics with server tests, including the secret mismatch and framing cases.
Resolve the secret grammar and publish a supported-feature matrix.

Run integration tests using a disposable server/test database: PKCE success and
failure, onboarding-required rejection, token revocation/expiry/scopes, quota
failure, HTTP 429/413, reading, Live lifecycle, and SSH identity variants.
Do not rebuild the developer database as part of compatibility verification.

**Gate:** named operations are backed by implementation tests, documentation,
and a reproducible server baseline. Local mock tests alone are insufficient.

### 2. Complete the Go client for the verified customer surface

Add discovery (`SERVER INFO`, permission-aware `HELP`), account information and
quotas, translation metadata/catalogue where authorized, and typed result models
for identity, verses, translation references, Live state/stats/stack, and token
metadata. Keep unknown fields/codes available for forward compatibility.

Extract PKCE code exchange and logout/revocation requests into library methods;
keep browser orchestration and token persistence in the CLI. Represent transport,
protocol, and HTTP JSON failures distinctly, with status and server metadata.
Enforce request limits and cancellation. Preserve the current read/search/Live
surface while reconciling draft commands with the server.

**Gate:** standalone Go applications and CLI commands use the same client paths
and pass the server integration suite without personal/workspace authority leaks.

### 3. Make CLI authentication and output ready for publication

Named endpoint-bound profiles, explicit HTTP/SSH transport selection, stable
output, shell completion and destructive-command confirmation are implemented;
see `status.md` for progress and `output.md` for the stable contract. Native
Windows execution and hosted CI evidence remain before publication; native
Linux/arm64 and Fish runtime checks now pass.
Support automation tokens without exposing token values in command-line arguments.
Handle username onboarding, separate CLI credential quotas, expired/revoked
credentials, and revocation failures accurately. Align explicit SSH key validation
with server-supported algorithms while retaining OpenSSH agent/config behavior.

Finalize human output, stable typed JSON, NDJSON for supported streams, stderr
errors, exit codes, help, completion, cancellation, and destructive-command UX.
Do not silently fall back from bearer credentials to SSH. Secret-authorized SSH
subscription requires authentication and subscription on the same connection;
a separate one-shot secret command cannot prepare a later connection.

**Gate:** documented customer examples work against the verified server baseline;
Go 1.27.1 builds and representative native tests pass on Linux/macOS/Windows.

### 4. Extend the server integration surface for workspaces and events

Agree a bearer-authenticated contract for workspace discovery/selection, workspace
Live creation/movement, member-scoped authority, and richer Live control. Decide
whether to extend v1 commands or add versioned JSON resources; keep the choice
behind typed client methods and reuse server authorization/domain logic.

Define audience and management event contracts separately: initial snapshot,
event types, revisions, reconnect/resynchronization, revocation, workspace moves,
access loss, and quota accounting. A snapshot on reconnect is not event replay.
Do not scrape dashboard HTML or reuse CSRF-protected browser forms as client APIs.
Personal token scopes must not grant organization powers without active membership;
the server contract must explicitly define how scopes and workspace authority combine.

**Gate:** server-side bearer authorization and contract tests exist before these
features appear as supported client methods. This milestone requires server work;
this plan revision does not modify the server checkout.

### 5. Validate portability with Python, then Ruby and Rust

Implement Python against the verified core contract first, using idiomatic
exceptions, cancellation, and typed results. Reuse request/response fixtures and
the integration suite. Port to Ruby and Rust after Python reveals cross-language
ambiguities. Add workspace/events only when milestone 4's contract is ready.

**Gate:** each package states the operations, transports, language/runtime minimum,
and tested server baseline it supports. Releases need not have equal feature coverage.

### 6. Publish independently

Set stable module/package paths before registry publication. Release CLI and
clients independently, run change-scoped CI, and maintain a shared feature matrix.
Publish CLI binaries/checksums for Linux/macOS/Windows on amd64/arm64, test native
TLS/login/process behavior, and document the optional external OpenSSH dependency.
Coordinate server documentation with the first CLI release. Add installer and
package-manager distribution after release artifacts and upgrade paths work.

## Immediate next work

Start with milestone 1: resolve `SECRET SET`, build the operation/transport matrix,
and add server-verified request fixtures and disposable integration tests. Then
align SSH validation and HTTP size/error handling. Defer new language clients,
repository migration, and browser-only feature wrappers until their contracts
are concrete.
